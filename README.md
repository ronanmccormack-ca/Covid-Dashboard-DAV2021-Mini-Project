# COVID Dashboard Project

This project is a COVID dashboard that collects, cleans, and displays COVID-19 data using Python's Pandas library for data manipulation and Python Dash for interactive data visualization. The entire dashboard can be run within a Jupyter Notebook environment.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create an interactive dashboard that provides insights into COVID-19 data. The project is designed to be easily runnable within a Jupyter Notebook, without the need for separate application deployment.

## Getting Started

To run the COVID dashboard within a Jupyter Notebook, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Open the `COVID_Dashboard.ipynb` notebook using Jupyter Notebook.

3. Run the notebook cells sequentially. The notebook includes code for data collection, cleaning, and creating the interactive dashboard using Python Dash.

4. As you run the cells, the dashboard components will be displayed within the notebook itself.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `COVID_Dashboard.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook containing the entire project, including code and visualizations.
